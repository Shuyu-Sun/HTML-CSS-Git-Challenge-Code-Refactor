# week1-homework

For this week, we were given a codebase of a company website that required us to improve.

I refactored existing webpage to make it accessible, I changed all "div" and "span" tags to "nav", "article" and "aside", I used "alt" for all the images.

I added "id" element to the Seearch Engine Optimization so that users can navigate direct to the content.

I also bundled up repeated css code making it more easier to read and more efficient.
